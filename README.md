## 👩‍💻 About Me

I’m a Computer Science undergraduate passionate about building systems that combine intelligence, performance, and clean user experience.

With a strong foundation in Data Structures, Algorithms, and core CS fundamentals, I focus on writing structured, scalable, and efficient solutions. I enjoy working across the stack — from intuitive front-end interfaces to optimized backend logic and AI-driven systems.

My projects often center around real-world impact — whether it's algorithm visualization, AI-powered proctoring systems, or automation tools that reduce manual effort significantly.

Beyond development, I actively lead and mentor peers, organize technical initiatives, and continuously challenge myself through hackathons and innovation competitions.

I believe in consistency over hype and depth over shortcuts.
